            <h3>Hello! My name is Jason.</h3>
            <h4>I'm from Columbus, OH.</h4>
            <p>
              I'm a future web/software developer currently studying with
              Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Right now, I'm focused on learning and expanding my knowledge of
              all things development, and I'm currently working on HTML/CSS and
              Javascript! Soon, I'll be on to React, and by the end of the
              course, I will be a fully qualified full-stack developer! In
              addition, I am studying other languages, libraries, and tools in
              my free time, just to keep things fresh. I love a challenge, and
              learning new things is among my favorite pastimes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep an eye on this page! It will be updated frequently as I
              continue this adventure in coding.

            <h3>Why I Became a Developer</h3>
            <p>
              For almost ten years, I drove a semi truck for various companies.
              My drive and ambition brought me to the top of my field, and at 36
              years old, I found myself driving for one of the top fleets in the
              country. I was proud of my accomplishments, but when I asked
              myself if this was the job I wanted to have for the rest of my
              life, I found that I had a lot of trouble saying yes. As far as
              I'd come, I knew that I was destined for more, and so I decided to
              pursue my life-long dream of getting in to software development.
            </p>
            <div class="bashbx">
              <p class="bashtxt">
                $ mv truck_driver software_engineer<span class="blinking"
                  >|</span
                >
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              My journey in to coding began when I reached the pinnacle of my
              truck driving career, and now I find myself starting at the very
              beginning of a new life, full of exciting potential. For almost a
              decade, I spent my time working alone, independently, relying only
              on myself and my own skills to keep myself out of trouble and
              finish the job on time. I am looking forward most of all to
              working on teams, meeting new people, making new friends, and
              learning everything I can about coding with other people to help
              me along the way. As I get older, I am starting to appreciate the
              idea of working on a team, and not alone, more and more.

            <h3>Life Away From the Keyboard</h3>
            <p>
              For almost ten years, I drove a truck. I got to see many places in
              this country as I passed through them, but never stayed in one
              place for long. Though the hours were grueling and the work often
              tedious and sometimes dangerous, the lifestyle suited me because
              I'm always ready and eager to face the next challenge. From the
              careful precision and control of maneuvering an 80,000 pound
              big-rig down a steep hill, to the timing and coordination
              necessary to navigate tight docks and unyielding parking lots, I
              always felt challenged.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm facing new challenges, but applying the same skills and
              attributes I picked up behind the wheel to them every day.
              Precision, adaptability, perseverance, level-headedness,
              patience, and problem-solving. I spent almost ten years helping to
              ensure that the products you know and love made it to your store
              shelves. And now, I want to spend my time making sure the software
              you use every day makes it in to your hands, ready to use or
              implement.
            </p>
            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
              Aside from coding and learning, I have a lot of passions that I
              pursue in my free time!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a certified Advanced Open Water scuba diver, and even though
              it's been a while since I've been in the water, I enjoy it
              whenever I get to dive. When I can, I like to ride horses and
              camp, and I've even been whitewater rafting! I enjoy the outdoors
              and I'm most relaxed when I'm surrounded by trees, mountains, or
              water.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also an avid gamer. From PC and console video games, to
              tabletop board games, and Dungeons and Dragons, I enjoy the
              camaraderie that comes with joining your friends in cooperative or
              competitive battle. Not to mention, the skills I've picked up as a
              Dungeons and Dragons Dungeonmaster look great on a resume!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I am passionate about craft beer. Especially local beers
              brewed here in Ohio! I enjoy all varieties of beer, and I can
              often be found visiting local breweries and biergartens, or
              looking through the local shops for my favorite brews. I am
              especially fond of stouts!
